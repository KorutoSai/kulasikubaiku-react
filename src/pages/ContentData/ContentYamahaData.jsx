    mcDescription:
      "Born to be a legend, SR400 remains timeless through the creativity of the builders that approach this authentic machine. Discover their unique designs. Yamaha has marketed the SR400 in the JDM since model year 1978, with a production hiatus for model years 2008â€“2009. The SR400 has an air-cooled 4-stroke single cylinder SOHC 2-valve engine with a dry-sump, with the downtubes of the motorcycle's frame serving as the engine's oil reservoir and cooling system, thereby eliminating the need for an external oil cooler, reducing engine pumping losses, and allowing increased ground clearance as well as reduced overall width. The bike's semi-double cradle frame uses high-strength steel.",
