      "A true middleweight naked sportbike for a broad range of riders, the Z650RS tempts the eye with the timeless beauty of a retro sport. Distinguishing the Z650RS from the larger  displacement Z900RS is a slimmer tank and a shorter, more compact tail—all contributing to light handling and an approachable nature. Experience modern responsive power and retro styling that's perfect for everyday riding on the Z650RS.",

    mcDescription:
      "The Kawasaki W175 is the newest member of the 'W' family. Going back years ago, Kawasaki’s original W, the 1966 W1, had gained recognition worldwide for having the largest displacement in its segment. This success became the brand’s first step in manufacturing large-displacement motorcycles. Now, embracing the W heritage, the W175 commuter bike aims to continue this legacy with its great performance without losing its retro style.",
